Student performance prediction:

**Introduction**

Problem: What factors has the most significant influence on a student's academic performance? 


Based on the student performance and behavior dataset from Kaggle, we can predict that a student's attendance percentage, participation score, study hours, stress level, family income, extracurricular activities and daily sleep hours contribute to the student's overall test scores. Many studies try to unravel different factors that shapes academic success, including examining the effects of diversity and immigration status or if self-interest affects academic achievement more than environmental influences. Both psychological and environmental factors should be considered for an individuals results.



This project analyzes factors influencing a student's academic performance using:
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for classification
- Neural Networks for deep learning
- K-Fold Cross Validation for resampling
